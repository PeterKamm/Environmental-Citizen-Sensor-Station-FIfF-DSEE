# Environmental Citizen Sensor Station

We develop an environmental sensorstation for outdoor use with a basic set of sensors, expandable with additional sensors.
Data transmission is based on [LoRaWAN.](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Wide_Area_Network)

This project is driven by FIfF members https://www.fiff.de/index.html

In 2022 the development of the prototype was founded by DSEE https://www.deutsche-stiftung-engagement-und-ehrenamt.de/

In 2022 we developed the prototype and now we are testing and continue to develop it.

We want to provide an open / open source, flexible Sensor Station for Environmental-Citizen-Sensoring and -Science without vendor-lock-in or datalink to producers.
