# Environmental-Citizen-Sensor-Station-FIfF-DSEE

We develop an environmental sensorstation for outdoor use with a basic set of sensors, expandable with additional sensors.
Data transmission is based on LoRaWAN.

This project is driven by FIfF members https://www.fiff.de/index.html
In 2022 it was founded by DSEE https://www.deutsche-stiftung-engagement-und-ehrenamt.de/
In 2022 we developed a prototype and now we are testing and continue to develop it.

We want to provide an open / open source, flexible Sensor Station for Environmental-Citizen-Sensoring and -Science without vendor-lock-in or datalink to producers.
